# Data Science Demo: Using Deep Learning for state of the art object detection

The material found in this repository was used for a [quick 45 minute demo](https://www.slideshare.net/MaxPumperla/data-science-in-practice)
to illustrate what data science might mean in practice. It features a few
interesting and intuitive demos. To get started, clone this repo and follow
the instructions. You can find the following demos here:

1. Motivational demos for visual cognition tasks. Run `python2 -m SimpleHTTPServer` and go to `localhost:8000` to check out the demos.
2. Training a Deep Learning model on an object detection task in your browser using a jupyter notebook. `cd` into the `yolo` folder and follow the instructions there.
3. An almost realistic security camera reporting application using Deep Learning. Again, make sure to `cd yolo` and follow the instructions in the readme.
